Goal of this project is to make a small app where people can randomly generate their workouts using certain paramaters.

1. As a user I want to be able to randomly generate exercises.
2. As a user I want to select musclegroups in which to randomly generate exercises.
3. As a user I want to be able to save these exercises 
4. As a user I want to be able to share these exercises I just did.
